## Chexers
Chexers is a three-player hexagonal turn-based race game. Test the loyalty of your band of two faced checkerpieces as you charge them through a twisting and treacherous battleground. Will all your pieces stay true to your cause? Can you earn yourself some new followers in the chaos? To win this tumultuous chase, you must double-cross and triple-cross your way across the finish line before your opponents--three, two, one... go!

## Project1 Searching
In this first part of the project, we will play a single-player variant of the game of Chexers. Before you read this specification, please make sure you have carefully read the entire `Rules for the Game of Chexers' document.

The aims for Project Part A are for you and your project partner to (1) refresh and extend your Python programming skills, (2) explore some of the new algorithms we have met in lectures so far, and (3) become more familiar with some core mechanics of Chexers. This is also a chance for you to invest some time developing fundamental Python tools for working with the game: some of the functions and classes you create now may be helpful later (when you are building your game-playing program for Project Part B).
