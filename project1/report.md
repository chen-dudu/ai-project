## search problem formulation
- _**State**_: player pieces and obstacle pieces' location on board
- _**Action**_: player can move, jump or exit one player piece per turn defined in specification
- _**Goal Test**_: no player's piece on board
- _**Path Cost**_: 1 cost per action

## search algorithms
### a* search 
- time complexity: 
- space complexity
- completeness
- optimality

### heuristic function
- admissibility

## problem feature impact
### search tree
- branching factor
- depth 

### other features of the input impact on search algorithm
- time complexity 
- space complexity
